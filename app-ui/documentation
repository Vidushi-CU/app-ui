run npm install to install all the packages used in this application

I have used all the git commands to create files, create branch, to commit, and to push.

for running the react application run ---> npm start
and the mock server is also been connected so it will also run with npm start only

Operating System used for Development is "Windows";

npm version : 6.14.11
